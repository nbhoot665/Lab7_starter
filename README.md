1. The best place to fit the automated tests in the Recipe project development pipeline is within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. Running automated tests within a Github action on every push helps to ensure that the codebase stays reliable and maintainable. It does this by preventing broken code inside pull requests from merging as it detects errors or bugs early.

2. No, we should not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output. This is because end to end tests are meant to test the entire system and not individual functions. A better test to check individual functions would be a unit test.

3. Navigation mode runs the core web essentials like interaction delay and layout shift, etc. but it does not track the page analytics after users have already interacted with the page. Snapshot mode takes the current static view an analzyes that but cant give you user interaction timing or load performance

4. The buttons names that are easy to use. There are many large uncompressed images so i think condesing those is important. I think cutting down on the CSS would help as well as you could inline much of the css to imporve the potency
